    <textOnly>Hi Jean-Luc

I thought you might like to know:

CK has now completed:
{!Contact.Modules_Completed__c} Modules
{!Contact.Projects_Completed__c} Projects
{!Contact.Superbadges_Completed__c} Superbadges
{!Contact.Peer_Assessments_Completed__c} Peer Assessments

Making a total of {!Contact.Total_Badge_Count__c} badges and {!Contact.Trailhead_Points__c} points.

He's also got {!Contact.Badges_In_Progress__c} badges in progress

If you want to stop these notifications, get Stephen to disable the Business Process named "JLL - CK Badge Alert" in his Trailhead monitoring org</textOnly>
